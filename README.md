## Symmetric chain description of the Hilbert polynomial associated to a Chow ring of matroids 

Consider a simple matroid $$\mathcal{M}$$, and let $$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{M}}$$ its lattice of flats. Consider $$\mathcal{G} \subset \mathcal{L}$$ a building set containing $$E = \max \mathcal{L}$$, and define $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ as the set of $\mathcal{G}$-nested sets.
    The Chow ring $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ is defined as
    \[ \mathcal{A}( \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}) := \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x_F]_{F \in \mathcal{G}}}{I + J},\]
    where $I$ is the ideal generated by the elements
    \[x_{F_1} \cdots x_{F_l}\] for $\{x_{F_1}, \dots , x_{F_l} \} \subset \mathcal{G}$ which are not $\mathcal{G}$-nested set; and $J$ is the ideal generated by elements \[\sum_{a \le F \in \mathcal{G}} x_F\] for every atom $a \in \mathcal{L}$.
    Observe that the Chow ring a graded algebra
    \[ \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}) = \bigoplus_{n=0}^r A^k.\]
    For more information about this see \cite{feichtner2004conciniprocesiwonderfularrangementmodels}.

    The Hilbert series associated to the graded algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{G})$ is
    \[ HS(t) = \sum_{k \ge 0} \dim A^k \cdot t^k.\]

    Feichtner and Yuzvinsky in \cite{Feichtner_2004}, provided a monomial basis for $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$, defined as
    \[ FY := \{ x_{F_1}^{m_1} \cdots x_{F_l}^{m_l} \, : \, N = \{F_1, \dots, F_l \} \text{ is }\mathcal{G} \text{-nested, and } 0 < m_i < m_{N}(F_i) \},\]
    where $m_N(F) = rk(F) - rk(\vee N_{<F}).$ Observe that by defining $FY^k$ as the set of elements of $FY$ of degree $k$, we have that $FY^k$ is a basis for $A^k$.

    In \cite{chowringsmatroidspermutation} Angarone, Nathanson and Reiner, cover the basis $FY$ with chains using the support function
    \[ supp_+ : FY \longrightarrow \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})\]
    called extended support map, defined as follows: if $m_i \ge 1$ for $1 \le i \le l$, then
    \[ supp_+(x_{F_1}^{m_1} \cdots x_{F_l}^{m_1l}) := \{F_1, \dots, F_l \} \cup \{E\};\]
    observe that $supp_+$ is well-defined because $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ is a simplicial complex, i.e.
    \[ \{F_1, \dots, F_l\} \in \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}) \implies \{F_1, \dots, F_l\} \cup \{E \} \in \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G}). \]
    where $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ is the set of $\mathcal{G}$-nested sets in $\mathcal{L}$.

    We want to use the function $supp_+$ to cover the set $FY$ using its fiber. Consider $N^+ =\{F_1, \dots, F_l, E\} \subset \mathcal{G}$ a $\mathcal{G}$-nested set in the image of $supp_+$ then the fiber has the following description
    \[ supp_+^{-1} (N^+) =  \left \{ \begin{matrix}
                                                          & \forall i \in \{1, \dots, l\} \\
           x_{F_1}^{m_1} \cdots x_{F_l}^{m_l} \cdot x_E^{m_{l+1}} : & 1 \le m_i \le m_{N^+}(F_i) - 1\\
                                                          & 0 \le m_{l+1} \le m_{N^+}(E)- 1\\
        \end{matrix} \right \}.\] 

    Once we covered $FY$ with the fibers of $supp^+$, which are disjoint, we want to cover every fibers with chains. In particular we cover them with symmetric chains.

    Since the grade of the elements in the fibers ranges in $[l, r-l]$, the fibers are symmetric with respect to the mid degree of the basis, and since the chains of the decomposition are symmetric in the fiber, they are also symmetric with respect to the mid degree of $FY$.

    We briefly introduce here these chains and the symmetric chain decomposition.

    Let $(\mathcal{P}, \le)$ a ranked poset with rank function $rk : \mathcal{P} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$, we say that the elements $x_1, \dots, x_h \in \mathcal{P}$ form a symmetric chain if :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x_{i+1} \gtrdot x_{i}$ for all $i < h$;
        \item $rk(x_1) + rk(x_h) = rk(\mathcal{P}).$
    \end{enumerate}
    where $rk(\mathcal{P})$ is the largest rank in $\mathcal{P}$.

    Let $(\mathcal{P}, \le)$ a ranked poset with rank function $rk : \mathcal{P} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}$, a symmetric chain decomposition of $\mathcal{P}$ is a set of disjoint symmetric chains that cover all the elements of $\mathcal{P}$.

    To learn more bout symmetric chain decomposition you can see \cite{anderson2002combinatorics}.

    As a result, ordering the fibers of $supp^+$ by divisibility we can apply the symmetric chain decomposition to every fiber and obtain a decomposition of $FY$ in chains.

    The aim of this work is to describe the Hilbert series associated to the Chow ring $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{G})$ in terms of the symmetric chains in the decomposition and of their characteristics.
    In the first chapter we introduce a polynomial $q(t)$, that we will prove to be equal to the Hilbert series.
    Next, in the second section, we will generalize the polynomial $q(t)$ and prove some properties of the new polynomial.
